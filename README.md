# Angular 8 + TypeScript Scaffold

### A starting point to build a project using Angular 8 in the frontend and TypeScript in the backend

## Features:
- Angular 8 with new engine [Ivy](https://blog.angularindepth.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-ivy-the-new-angular-engine-9cde471f42cf) enabled
- A complete Angular CLI project in the frontend
- A backend built in TypeScript with a simple API included
- CORS enabled by default
- A proxy for api requests to the backend
- Some examples added (pages, services, interfaces, etc...)

## Todo:
- Integrate Koji 'Customizations' with the app
- Set metadata to frontend pages & link them to Koji customizations
- Enable/disable CORS by using Koji customizations
- Add security to the frontend & backend
- Extend Webpack builds using the new Angular customs builders 
- PWA compatibility

## Getting Started
Make sure you have installed all npm packages needed in order to run the app. Otherwise, run a `npm i` in terminal in every folder (frontend/backend)

- Angular entry point template [here](#~/frontend/src/app/app.component.ts).
